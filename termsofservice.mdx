# Kolar Labs Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** 20 May 2025\
_Last Updated: 20 May 2025_

These Terms of Service (the “**Terms**”) constitute a legally binding agreement between you (“**you**” or “**User**”) and **Kolar Labs, Inc.**, a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Panama (“**Kolar Labs**,” “**we**,” “**our**,” or “**us**”), governing your access to and use of (i) the website located at [**piratecrew.ai**](http://piratecrew.ai) and any sub‑domains thereof, (ii) the **Pirate Crew** browser extension, and (iii) any other products or services that link to, or expressly incorporate, these Terms (collectively, the “**Platform**”). By accessing or using any part of the Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our **Privacy Policy** (https://piratecrew.fun/privacypolicy), which is incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Platform.

## 1. Eligibility & Geographic Restrictions

1.1 **Minimum Age.** You must be at least **18 years** old to access or use the Platform.\
1.2 **Excluded Jurisdictions.** Access to any sale, purchase, or distribution of digital assets on the Platform is prohibited for (a) residents, citizens, or persons located in **the United States of America** or **the Republic of Panama**, and (b) any location where such use would violate law (collectively, “**Restricted Territories**”).\

## 2. Blockchain Wallet & Non‑Custody Statement

You must connect a non‑custodial wallet to interact with on‑chain components. **You alone control the private keys. Losing your keys or seed phrase is irreversible and will result in permanent loss of assets.**\
**Kolar Labs at no point holds, controls, or has access to your private keys or funds; all transactions occur directly on the Solana blockchain via open‑source smart contracts.**

---

## 3. Platform Description

3.1 **Mini‑Games & Loyalty Points.** Browser‑based games award on‑chain loyalty points for in‑game actions. Loyalty points have **no monetary value**.\
3.2 **AI Agents.** Proprietary, non‑fungible AI characters purchasable in‑app; utility confined to gameplay.\
3.3 **Secondary NFT Trading.** Kolar Labs does not operate a marketplace; users may trade AI Agents on third‑party Solana marketplaces at their own risk. Royalty fees apply to each resale.\
3.4 **\$GOLD Presale.** Participants may contribute SOL to **signal interest in accessing platform features**. These contributions are acknowledged with a **non‑financial game token (\$GOLD)**, delivered as "claims" as the Platform rolls out. Periodic claims may be distributed **only** to presale participants. **\$GOLD is not a security, investment contract, or other financial product and is offered only outside Restricted Territories. \$GOLD functions as the Platform’s platform utility token: it can be used—but is not required—to interact with Crew‑Coin bonding curves, operating as an access token within the game layer and carries no promise of value appreciation. **Holders may also choose to lock their \$GOLD for variable durations (similar to a "vote‑escrow" model) in exchange for enhanced in‑game utility; locked \$GOLD remains non‑transferable until the chosen unlock date and confers no right to dividends, interest, or other returns.\*\*\*\*\
3.5 **\$GOLD Airdrops.** Airdrop allocations are calculated solely from each user’s on‑chain **Gold Points** (reflecting engagement and activity) and **not from any purchase**. \
3.6 **Crew coins.** Users may team up to form “Crews” and launch an optional, fungible **Crew Coin** collectible via the **Meteora DAMM v2 bonding‑curve** module. The bonding curve accepts **\$GOLD** as the sole funding currency. When the curve reaches its equilibrium, a liquidity pool is auto‑deployed on Meteora. Upon creation of a Crew Coin, 20 % of the total token supply is automatically vesting contract. timing and distribution method are at our sole discretion and subject to regulatory considerations. **Optionally, at the time of launch a Crew may direct the smart contract to airdrop a portion of its initial supply to a whitelist of wallet addresses—such list may include wallets that currently hold time‑locked \$GOLD ("\$GOLD lockers"). This discretionary airdrop, if implemented, is executed by the protocol and not guaranteed or underwritten by Kolar Labs.** **Crew Coins are not securities, investment contracts, or financial products, and are available only outside Restricted Territories.**\
3.7 **Issuer Status & Open‑Source Code.** Crew Coins are created by decentralized smart contracts on behalf of participating buyers. The underlying bonding‑curve contracts are **open‑source, immutable, and permissionless**; Kolar Labs cannot modify or reverse transactions once deployed and does **not** custody user assets. Kolar Labs acts solely as a technical facilitator and is **not** the issuer, guarantor, or underwriter of any Crew Coin.

3.8 **Bounty, Raid & Treasure‑Hunt Games.** The Platform may host skill‑based competitions—including bounty, megabounty, raid, and an optional “USD 1 million treasure hunt”—that reward participants based on their **total \$GOLD points**. No entry fee is required beyond installing the Chrome extension. Any advertised prize pool is **contingent on Kolar Labs’ available funds** and may be modified, reduced, or cancelled at our sole discretion. All prizes, if awarded, will be paid in **SOL**, and Kolar Labs reserves the right to verify winners’ on‑chain scores and disqualify fraudulent activity before payout.

5.2 **In‑App Purchases.** Prices are disclosed at point of sale; **all sales are final and non‑refundable**.\
5.3 **Presale Payments.** By participating in the presale you acknowledge that **\$GOLD is a platform utility token, not sold for investment purposes, and Kolar Labs makes no promise of future price appreciation.** If, at the time any tranche of \$GOLD becomes claimable, the on‑chain spot price (as reported by a widely used Solana DEX aggregator) is **below the presale price **, presale customers will receive a refund of the USD equivalent. Outside this limited price‑protection window, presale contributions are **irrevocable and non‑refundable**, and Kolar Labs has no obligation to repurchase or compensate you for any loss.

5.4 **Network Fees.** You bear all Solana transaction fees.\
5.5 **Bonding‑Curve & Liquidity Fees.** Kolar Labs charges a protocol transaction fee on each buy or sell executed against a Crew’s bonding curve and may collect liquidity‑provider fees on swaps executed in any post‑launch pool.
